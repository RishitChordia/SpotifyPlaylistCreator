The code is meant to create a playlist having songs similar in genre to the songs you give as input.  
Very similar to the song radio feature in spotify, but useful for narrowing down the exact type of song by inputting multiple similar songs.  

  
To run:  

Replace the CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET in the file create_playlist.py with yours
